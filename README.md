Particle Toggl Button
========

A Particle and Node powered Toggl button. Starts and stops tracking your time via a physical button press.

If you make something wonderful from this, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy.

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com. I've got a range of different IoT/wearable/VR/AR demos up there!

I've also got a site dedicated to developer resources for emerging tech like the IoT, wearables, VR, AR and artificial intelligence over at http://www.devdiner.com :)
